## 4. PEAS Environment

Performance Measures: accurate stock price forecast, accurate stock price trend

Environment: shareholders, financial institutions, past stock data and trends

Actuators: stock forecast UI, website, software

Sensor: dataset API, crawler

Rational depends on the performance measure that defines success. Stock prediction uses accurate stock price forecasts, accurate stock price trends as performance measures. Also, for each possible percept sequence, the stock prediction system selects an action expected to maximize its performance measure, given the evidence provided by the percept sequence and whatever built-in knowledge the agent has. For example, in stock prediction, system gives stock forecast UI based on dataset API and crawler.

For different financial institutions -> we need to use different dataset API -> website and stock forecast UI will be changed

For past stock data and trends -> use crawler -> stock forecast UI, website, and software will be different
